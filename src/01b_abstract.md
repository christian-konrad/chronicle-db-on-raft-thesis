\todo{Write abstract}

about 1/2 page:
(1) Motivation (Why do we care?)
(2) Problem statement (What problem are we trying to solve?)
(3) Approach (How did we go about it)
(4) Results (What's the answer?)
(5) Conclusion (What are the implications of the answer?)

<!--
Modern applications (?) like IoT... ingesting sensoric data... and analyzing those data... rely on event stores to store and process events in real time... 

Fault tolerance and high availability is a key requirement to those systems... with different consumers writing and reading different portions of those events at the same time...

low latency and high throughput, while ensuring different correctness constraints... geographically distributed...

TODO this style https://software.imdea.org/~gotsman/papers/unistore-atc21.pdf and find more use-case related reasoning regarding Event Processing, EPA... for example. inspiration from Kafka and Spark
