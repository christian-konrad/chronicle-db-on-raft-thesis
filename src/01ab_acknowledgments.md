\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

This work would not have been possible without the patience of many people around me, who have backed off while I was busy working on this thesis day and night. Things were a bit complicated when I was writing this thesis and doing the preliminary work, so I am all the more grateful for their support. This includes my family, my partner, my son, and my friends. Now that this is done, I turn my attention back to you (at least until the next big thing catches my attention).

I thank my reviewers Nikolaus Glombiewski and Michael Körber for their continuous support and for never getting frustrated when I did not manage to respond in a timely manner. Their advice about not letting the scope of this work get too large was important for me to stay focused (but I still have a lot to talk about, as working on this topic really put me in a flow at times).

Many thanks to Alexander Markowetz for advising me not only regarding this thesis, but also on general career questions that helped me figure out what I want to be about in the next few years and how to settle into a field that will satisfy me in my future career. He is a great person to talk to—and a pleasure to listen to.

Thanks to my partner Sarah for motivating me to finish my master's degree and write this thesis. She was very insistent—and I'm grateful to her for that, because otherwise you wouldn't be reading this now.
