# Implementation {#sec:implementation}


1-2 sentences on what this chapter is about. It starts looking at existing implementations of Raft and replication protocols in general for data-intense applications and how they differentiate. Then it compares other event stores with ChronicleDB and their approaches to replication. Afterwards, it describes the system design and architecture of the solution, (and finally it will reference the solution in particular (should I really show the code? Or just latex algos in the system design and omit details)).
